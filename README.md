# Todo-List

This project is a todo-list webapp I made for "The Odin Project". For this project, I attempted to create a todo-list in javascript with the help of webpack. This project also makes use of localstorage and various javascript concepts (factory functions, modules, etc.) to create a fully functioning app.

While working on this project I...

* Employed CSS variables to make colors and font easier to configure
* Improved my CSS structure
* Removed IDs and reduced use of global selectors for CSS code
* Added CSS mediaqueries for smaller devices
* Used webpack sourcemaps to code more efficiently
* Used webpack for installing npm packages such as "date-fns"
* Learned to use the "date-fns" package for handling dates
* Relearned to use localstorage to store project data
